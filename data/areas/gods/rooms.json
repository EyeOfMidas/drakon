		"description": "You find yourself in a cozy little room.\nThis is the place where Thoric comes to relax, and get inspired!\nLooking around yourself, you find this to be quite a comfortable, medieval room, which seems to be inside some sort of log cabin.  There's a very nice-looking leather chair here in front of a huge fireplace, with a good blaze going. On the mantle you see a fine assortment of pipes, and a couple jars of high quality pipeweed.\nOn the floor you spot a full bear-skin rug in front of the fireplace, and you suddenly get the urge to make yourself comfortable in front of the fire with a mug of hot coffee, fill a pipe up with some pipeweed, relax and listen to tales of days long past."
